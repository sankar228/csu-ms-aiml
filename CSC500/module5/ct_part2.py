Part 2:

The CSU Global Bookstore has a book club that awards points to its students based on the number of books purchased each month. The points are awarded as follows:

    If a customer purchases 0 books, they earn 0 points.
    If a customer purchases 2 books, they earn 5 points.
    If a customer purchases 4 books, they earn 15 points.
    If a customer purchases 6 books, they earn 30 points.
    If a customer purchases 8 or more books, they earn 60 points.

Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of books that they have purchased this month and then display the number of points awarded.
